Hey, I'm Jacob! I'm a software engineer based in London, UK.

I'm an Android developer at Capital One, but I completed rotations in a few
different areas over the course of my time on the graduate programme.

As well as the coding, throughout my time here I've also played a major part in
organising our summer internship programme.

Outside of work, youâ€™ll find me engrossed in a book or watching the F1, but I
also love to travel and take photos!
