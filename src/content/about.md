Hey, I'm Jacob! I'm an Android developer at Capital One, based in London, UK.

Throughout my time here on the graduate programme I also spent time as a web
developer and working on backend services.

As well as coding, throughout my time here I've played a major part in
organising our summer internship and I now lead the team working towards the
2025 programme.

Outside of work youâ€™ll find me engrossed in a book or watching the F1, but I
also love to travel and take photos!
